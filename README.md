# Image Uploader
A CRUD app with Images using NestJS.

Run the app and visit `127.0.0.1:3000` to try it.

I though about using an ENV file but I wanted to keep things simple for now. There is nothing secret in the app, so it's OK.

The app will try to connect to a database named `nest` on a local MongoDB server.
